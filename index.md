## Welcome to my Portfolio Page

The page offers an insight into some of the projects I have been working on.


### [Visualization with Tableau](tableau.com)

#### [Possum migration](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sarah.reisenbauer#!/vizhome/PossumTracking/Dashboard1)

Do Possums in New Zealand migrate in far fetched areas or do they prefer to have a fixed territory?


#### [Carbon vs N2O](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sarah.reisenbauer#!/vizhome/Caremissions/Dashboard1)

Are cars with high carbon emissions also bad at N2O?


### [Nepal Earthquake - Random forest](https://github.com/Sarahbjik/nepal_earthquake_classification/blob/main/nepal_earthquake.ipynb)

In a 2015 earthquake in Nepal a lot of buildings were damaged. The severity of the damage was recorded along with parameters of the building. Is it possible to predict which houses are at higher risk in the future? 


### [K-Means Algorithm - Inside the Code](https://github.com/Sarahbjik/representative_based_clustering/blob/main/inside_kmeans.ipynb)

The k-means algorithm is used to determine a number of k clusters from an arbitrary amount of (unlabeled) data points, without hierarchical relationships, residing in a defined number of dimensions. It is run in iterations, which upon convergence yield representatives for k cluster centres. A commonly used optimization target is the minimization of the sum of squared Euclidian distances of the data points to a representative. However, the algorithm is sensitive to local optima.

To understand the workings of the algorithm it is

1. implemented in single iterations and 
2. used to determine the most dominant colours in an image
