## Welcome to my Portfolio Page

The page contains a compilation of some of the projects I have been working on.

#

### [Visualization with Tableau](http://tableau.com)

#### [Possum migration](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sarah.reisenbauer#!/vizhome/PossumTracking/Dashboard1)

Do Possums in New Zealand migrate in far fetched areas or do they prefer to have a fixed territory?


#### [Carbon vs N2O](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sarah.reisenbauer#!/vizhome/Caremissions/Dashboard1)
<img src="https://github.com/Sarahbjik/sarahbjik.github.io/blob/main/carbondioxide_vs_n2o.png?raw=true" width="450" />

Are cars with high carbon emissions also bad at N2O?

### [Nepal Earthquake - Random forest](https://github.com/Sarahbjik/nepal_earthquake_classification/blob/main/nepal_earthquake.ipynb)

<img src="https://github.com/Sarahbjik/nepal_earthquake_classification/blob/main/nepal_eq.png?raw=true" width="350" />

In a 2015 earthquake in Nepal a lot of buildings were damaged. The severity of the damage was recorded along with parameters of the building. Is it possible to predict which houses are at higher risk in the future?

### [K-Means Algorithm - Inside the Code](https://github.com/Sarahbjik/representative_based_clustering/blob/main/inside_kmeans.ipynb)

The k-means algorithm is used to determine a number of k clusters from an arbitrary amount of (unlabeled) data points, without hierarchical relationships, residing in a defined number of dimensions. It is run in iterations, which upon convergence yield representatives for k cluster centres. A commonly used optimization target is the minimization of the sum of squared Euclidian distances of the data points to a representative. However, the algorithm is sensitive to local optima.

To understand the workings of the algorithm it is

1. implemented in single iterations and 
2. used to determine the most dominant colours in an image

### [A Big Data Quantum Physics Experiment](https://www.dropbox.com/preview/Dissertation/Reisenbauer_Thesis.pdf)

<img src="https://github.com/Sarahbjik/sarahbjik.github.io/blob/main/6_3_condProb.png?raw=true" width="400" />

My PhD thesis project included the construction and management of a Python based environment for a quantum physics experiment. It involved the analysis of 430 TB of raw data in almost real time over the course of data capture within two weeks and to filter 25 relevant target events per hour.
